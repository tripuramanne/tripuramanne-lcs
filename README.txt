Type "make" to compile both the source codes "manne_tripura_pa3_lcs.c" and "manne_tripura_pa3_floyd.c"
Now, the object files of both the source codes are created as "lcs" and "floyd" respectively
Run the first code as "./lcs string1 string2" and the second code as "./floyd"

Use "make clean" to delete the target files
